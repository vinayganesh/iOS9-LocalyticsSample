# iOS9-LocalyticsSample
This is a sample iOS application which shows how to, 

1. Use UINavigationController programmatically with xib files

2. Use Localytics with your app. 

Prerequisites

1. Create an account on Localytics.

2. Get the app key.

Once you have the app key, just it into the ```initializeLocalytics``` funtion in the AppDelegate.m file of the application and run the application. Run the application few times, closing/opening over and over again so that there are some number of activities that you can see on the localytics dashboard.
